# Alice-3
Projects completed using Alice 3


Using Alice, you can place objects from a gallery into a virtual world and then create 
programming statements to animate the objects in the world in a fun and engaging way

This repo contains all the projects created using Alice 3. Most of the projects are
animations but more interactive projects can also be found. 

If the project is inside a file, it contains a back up folder (.bak) and the Alice 3
file (.a3p)
